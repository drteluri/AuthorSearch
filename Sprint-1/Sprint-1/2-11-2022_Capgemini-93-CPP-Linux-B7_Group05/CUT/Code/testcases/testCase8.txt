Project Title=A research on blogging as a platform to enhance language skills
Abstract=The incorporation of asynchronous computer-mediated communication in the classroom is currently in need of research. 
In the present study we observe the effect of the implementation of this technique to improve writing and students’ motivation. 
Students worked in groups and got involved in professional blogs posting responses and exchanging comments with the other groups. 
The analysis of the results shows a high motivation of the students. Writing for a purpose has encouraged them to produce language 
more fluently and be more concerned on correctness, which leads us to consider blogs as a potential tool for the development of 
linguistic skills.
