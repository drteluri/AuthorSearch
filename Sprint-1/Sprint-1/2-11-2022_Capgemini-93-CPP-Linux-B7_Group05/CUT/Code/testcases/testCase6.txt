Project Title=Effects of Balance Training on Balance Performance in Healthy Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
Abstract=The effects of balance training (BT) in older adults on proxies of postural control and mobility are well documented in the literature. 
However, evidence-based dose-response relationships in BT modalities (i.e., training period, training frequency, training volume) have not yet been 
established in healthy older adults.
